# Introduction-to-Algorithms
This contains file are programs and notes that I create as I read Introduction
to Algorithms 3rd edition.  The book can be found on
[amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-Edition-Thomas-Cormen/dp/0262033844)
or on [MIT press](http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms).In
addition to this book I will also be using [MIT open course
ware](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-046j-introduction-to-algorithms-sma-5503-fall-2005/).
The accuracy of these answer are not guaranteed to be correct. And the programs
are not guaranteed to be correct or bug free. Use them at your own risk.  Notes
will done in latex. My main languages of choice in order of use will be C for
imperative and procedural programming, C+ for object orientation programming,
Haskell for functional programming, VHDL for hardware description language and
if necessary SQL for large data sets. Occasionally, I will dissemble C code and
read the assembly. 


The chapter of the book is broken into eight parts. In each part, it is my
intention to keep a consistent formatting of both my code and formatting. The
structure of each part will remain consistent. But my formatting between parts
will not remain the same. As I refine file structure, coding style, and
documentation, I will not maintain previous parts.  

Current Chapter 1.
