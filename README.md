# Introduction-to-Algorithms
This contains programs and notes that I create as I read Introduction to Algorithms 3rd edition.

In addition to this book I will also be using MIT open course ware.

The chapter of the book is broken into eight parts. In each part, it is my intention
to keep a consistent formatting of both my code and formatting. But my
formatting between parts will not remain the same. As I refine file structure,
coding style, and documentation, I will not maintain previous parts.  

Current Chapter 1.
